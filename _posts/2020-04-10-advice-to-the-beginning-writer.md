*“It really comes down to this: indifference to everything except that piece of paper in the typewriter.”* 
Raymond Carver

*“If you can speak what you will never hear, if you can write what you will never read, you have done rare things.”*
Henry David Thoreau

## 1. Writing in general

Good and talented writing is foremost clear and logic; it avoids errors, is direct, simple, brief, vigorous, lucid, precise and evocative; it suspends disbelief and earns the reader’s trust; it is truthful concerning descriptions of persons and objects; it has audacity, originality, and compassion. Good and talented writing conveys massive amounts of (implied) information and favourable impressions of the communicator with minimal effort by the reader. Beyond that major writing is energetic, makes things happen vividly and forcefully in the reader’s mind; it seduces the reader; it uses rhetorical parallels and differences; it pays attention to the sounds and rhythms of its sentences.  
A major writer combines the storyteller, the teacher, and the enchanter. The storyteller entertains, excites, and gives pleasure of traveling in some remote region in space and time. The teacher, a propagandist, a moralist, or a prophet, provides moral education and gives direct knowledge, the simple facts. The most important part takes the enchanter who puts the reader under a spell.

First, is it hard work to just think about writing? Yes? Then do something else. No? Then always remember: A writer must have something to say; has a duty to be good, true, lively, and accurate; has to handle exposition the right way; has imaginary ability and a sense of subtext; has passion and insight and understands human behaviour. Do you still want to pursue the path of a good writer? Then read a lot of good books, work with what fascinates you and don’t listen to the market (don’t be trendy and ‘new’), have focused fun, be patient with chaos, and, as Ngugi wa Thiong’o says, “write, write, write and write again, and you will get it right.”

It is easy to become a writer; staying a writer is much tougher. So keep going! If you do the writing with enough assurance and confidence, you can do whatever you like. Write your story as it needs to be written, honestly and as best as possible. There is the word ‘published’ for a writer who never gives up.

### Writing habits

There are two kinds of writers: The Macro Planer who takes notes, organises material, configures a plot and creates a structure before writing the first page, and then there is the Micro Manager who starts writing straight away and builds up his work piece by piece until he/she finishes the last sentence.

Set a quota and work regular hours, not according to mood, and protect the time and space in which you write — keep everyone away and turn off any disturbances (phone and internet). Work only on one thing at a time. Work calmly, don’t be nervous, and work recklessly and with pleasure only. Cement a little every day. Work, if you cannot create, and when you are stuck, clean the room, see people, go for a walk, go places, drink, listen to music, watch a movie, read a book—feed your inner life. But finish what you are writing. Write well. If you cannot write well, you cannot think well, and if you cannot think well, others will do the thinking for you. Think about the story, it has intellectual, imaginative, and aesthetic demands. Think about the sentence, the paragraph and the page. Avoid mysticism that covers a lack of knowledge or the inability to state clearly.  Never give up!

## 2. Inspiration and Creativity

The germ of a story may derive from something seen or heard or remembered, but it may not even involve intelligible thoughts or involve words. Mood, resonances, mental glimpses, voices, emotions, visions, and dreams are fuel for the story. The story-beginning phase can be triggered from outside, but arises in the unconscious mind. The fuel has to incubate before it becomes a story (the brain works while being idle). While hiking, breaking routines, or during useful passivity, the ideas come — wait patiently. Or start writing and inspiration may come.  
Sound, syntax, images, ideas, and feelings come together. In the author a feeling connects itself to an image that will express it. The image leads to an idea which will find words, and words will lead to other words that make new images of characters of the story who do things that express the underlying feelings and ideas that resonate with each other. If this process somehow breaks or is incomplete at the conception stage or while writing or while revising then the result will be a weak or failed story.  
Thinking rather than reacting is the right strategy. The author broods, e.g. asks questions and answers them in various fashions before choosing the final answer. Or the process takes place in the unconscious mind. The author asks: What does the reader need to know next? In answering, the author is radical and outrageous — if he has the guts. Or, while writing, the author tries to find out something he does not know or does not want to know. In gradual steps a problem leads to a solution which leads to another problem and so on. Self-doubt is the worst enemy to creativity.  

## 3. The Draft

First disconnect the computer from the internet. Be alone and protect your time and space from everyone. Write to one person—imagined or real. Writing one page a day is enough. Starting with a bad beginning requires courage and everything can be revised or rearranged at a later time. So get going. Knowing the end of a story and having to work towards that end may help in starting the process. Or know the beginning and then proceed from there. Every sentence must either reveal character or advance the action of the story. For it to be good, do not impress but write to express. Do not write too much at a time. Do not reach the point where you cannot write anything anymore, leave some for the next day.   
All beginning is bad. Write or rewrite so the reader remembers the story as something he has experienced. Write the first draft in a fast pace to get the outline of the story on paper. Revise and correct it later, or, like Hemingway does, revise while writing the draft but revising/rewriting should not be an excuse for not continuing and it might interfere with the flow and rhythm which comes with an unconscious association with the material. During writing, any excitement is no sign of the value of one's devotion. Scenes that are dare to you might be out of place. Do not ramble. Keep it simple and specific and be precise. Write the way you talk. Write short words, short sentences, and short paragraphs. Do not use jargon. Authenticity and clarity of emotion and senses is the goal. Details are important. Capture reality. Do not be afraid to write the truth. The writing should pass all boundaries of language, culture and time.

### 3.1. Context

Have you noticed something? Do you have something to say? Discover the truths in yourself. Tell the truth. Write what you know, about happiness, sadness, longing, dislike, displeasure, resentment, fault-finding, imagination, passionate remonstrance, and the sense of injustice. What moves your heart? Listen! Where is the pain? What invokes pleasures in you? What do you care about? What is interesting to YOU? Write what excites you. Write about the thing that makes you feel uncomfortable without making the reader uncomfortable. Write for yourself.  
Write first sentences that invoke interest in the reader, then a lot of middle and finally last sentences that complete the picture. Pull the string of the story tight. Do not be dull, boring, and pretentious. Write well and convincingly and give your readers as much information as possible as soon as possible. Start as close to the end as possible. The heart of a story is usually a place to arrive at. Get into the scene quickly. There has to be a rhythm in the writing.

#### Characters

The story needs at least one leading and intriguing character the reader can get attached to. The character(s) should want something. Then give the character(s) some trouble. The characters should feel real; projected from the writer’s experience. The plot is build around the characters who act and talk in a certain way and are more important than plot; something plausible and interesting must happen to them and the character does something about it. The plot comes out of the desires, wishes and motivations of the characters. The unexpected dialog or action of a character is important. Dialogue must be short and snappy, with the right voice and sense of rhythm. Write the dialogue while saying it out loud.  
One way of creating suspense is to make the reader understand what is at stake. The more is at stake for the character, the more potential for suspense. Make the reader ask a question to create suspense, then withhold the answer as long as possible, through false leads, side quests, and diversions.

### 3.2. Style

Clarity, brevity, humanity, and simplicity are four basic premises of writing, with simplicity being the ultimate sophistication. Write short sentences where sense and sound fit (perfectly) and avoid too many pronouns, subordinate clauses, rhetorical adornments, useless amplification, and superfluity of expression. Do not write prose that calls attention to itself.

### 3.3. Voice

Sound like yourself; find out who you really are. Write with intention (an emotional tone). Experiment with different points of view. Edit your work multiple times (e.g. change weak words). Know the basics to construct nice and clear sentences and paragraphs. Relax, voice is not the most important issue in your writing. Explore the world deeply with your senses. Look at things in many ways. Put what you feel, hear, see, touch into language.

## 4. Editing and Revision

Let the draft ‘rest’ for a while. Then read it as if you have not read it before or, better, as an enemy. Also give it to people whose opinion you respect. If they say something is wrong or does not work for them, they are almost always right. Either finish the draft and then revise and rewrite it 3 to 4 times or go back to the beginning every day and revise. It is through the rewriting that it will improve and you will learn. Delete everything that you can — the ornamental and descriptive — to its simplest, clearest, easiest-to-understand form. Leave in it the emotional development, the texture of feeling, and the details that make the story more real. The story is the essential progression of incidents that occur to the main character (hero) in pursuit of her one goal. So have the guts to cut and what is left often springs to life. You want sentences “clean as bone” and that illuminate the subject in some new and useful way. A total stranger who reads the story should not feel the time is wasted.  
Focus on patterns of the language (sounds of words), of syntax and grammar (pace, gait, shape in time), of the images and senses, of the ideas (what makes us understand), and of feelings (emotional or spiritual experience). Let it go, before it ever reaches perfection, and write the next story.
