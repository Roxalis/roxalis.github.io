Tom sat nervously in a crowded diner, sweltered, and drank his coffee. A thin waitress rushed about and worked hard to please all the strangers. "I'd like to pay," Tom shouted over to her. Four minutes later he had left the diner, had crossed the icy road, and had entered his Buick Riviera. While driving down Liberty Street he opened the newly bought pack. He put a cigarette in his mouth — his hand was shaking — and smoked. Tom coughed, since he had never smoked before. "This is a nightmare!" he cried out. "I must drive back, but I can't. Someone might see me."
A few hours ago, they had taken a walk in the dark. Lisa had said she loved him. She had told him about their baby. Suddenly, anger had overwhelmed him. And then it just happened, Tom concluded his thoughts.  

“I still love you. Why can't I just forget you, Tom, after what you have done? You left me here. This place — although unknown to me — reminds me of the farm. Home. The deep and dark woods, snowy fields, and crows searching for food. In the summer, Mummy baked lovely cookies and served them still hot on the porch while Father told us stories. And then you entered my life. Everyone was delighted. ‘So handsome,’ they said. I loved it when you made me laugh. Always opened the door for me. Intelligent. A good heart — it seemed then!” Lisa stepped over her own dead body and trudged towards the rising sun. She moaned in despair and the crows stopped singing.
