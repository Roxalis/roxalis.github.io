#### Bad models and belief manipulation during the formation of the real estate bubble

While the real-estate bubble developed 1999 to 2006 levered banks (creditors) increased their holdings in subprime loans and subprime-linked securities that posed significant risks. During the same period home buyers (the debtors) took up an oversupply of credit in the form of subprime mortgage loans. The banks manufactured the subprime loans into special security products (mortgage-backed securities) that became overrated by credit rating agencies (e.g. Moody´s, Standard & Poor). The offering of these products and an increase in price caused investors to become enthusiastic buyers, which led to a continued increase in equity demand and price.

In this context, there are two theories of high importance, the “bad models” theory and extrapolation. Employees at the mortgage desks were unaware of the risks embedded in mortgage products because of faulty reasoning. Barberis suggests that bankers, analysts, and investors followed a natural tendency to believe in the continuation of price increases and over-extrapolated the past growth in home prices into the future. The analysts may have applied representativeness heuristic, the psychological tendency to judge an event by its similarity to the characteristics of its parent population. Initially, the interference led to the over-extrapolation. The representativeness heuristic made it easy for analysts to believe that house prices would keep rising. This belief made them blind to inherent risks, defaults in subprime loans and losses in subprime-linked securities.

The tendency of belief manipulation might explain, why the bank employees acted as if the high risks for their institutions, their customers and the broader financial markets did not exist. They knew of this risk. But through belief manipulation and outright ignorance they relieved themselves from the feeling of wrongdoing. Bankers and analysts were unaware of the risks because they choose to be. The complexity of the subprime-linked products prevented considerable effort to disprove the claim the securities were safe, hence, they ignored the risks.

#### Bursting of the bubble 2007 - 2008 and the effect of loss and ambiguity aversion

The falling of house prices in 2007 led to the devaluation of those holdings and a run on the banking system began. As a result, banks reduced the supply of credit to the economy. Small subprime losses transformed into greater price declines of all kinds of risky assets. The stock market crashed. Two psychological amplification mechanisms - loss aversion and ambiguity aversion - played a significant role in these events. Observing the great loss in risky assets, investors, already confused by the developments, experienced loss aversion. It triggered an impulse to reduce equity holdings, and investors experienced ambiguity aversion, the feeling of losing competence in analyzing an asset class. These experiences increased their ambiguity aversion and loss aversion. In consequence, they closed out their positions, and overall the prices declined.
