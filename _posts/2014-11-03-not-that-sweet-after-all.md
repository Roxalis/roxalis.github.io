*Geniuses can be scintillating and geniuses can be somber, but it’s that unescapable sorrowful depth that shines through — originality.*[^fn1]

&#8212; Jack Kerouac, 1962

Daniel Coyle sets himself a mission. He visits locations in the US, Brazil and other places where young people learn skills. In “chicken-wire Harvards”, places with low-quality training facilities that give birth to well-skilled people, he explores the processes of practice and learning. Coyle develops a theory of deep practice, which is supposed to contradict the idea of natural talent.

According to Coyle, people at the talent hotbeds purposely reach for the challenge and thereby train at their limits while learning a skill. They fail and through the process of trial and error they advance. Practicing and learning a new skill can not be reduced to pure concepts of willpower, concentration and focus because these words exclude the struggle individuals experience during the exercise of a new capability (13).

Coyle calls this kind of learning process "deep practice", an activity that to him is “strange” (14) and “paradox” (18). “When you’re practicing deeply, the world’s usual rules are suspended,” Daniel Coyle writes (19). “The trick is to choose a goal just beyond your present abilities” and to “target the struggle.” Under normal circumstances, people would avoid the kind of conflict affiliated with learning. However, it is this battle with oneself that leads to the desired success (20). The process of making errors forces a slow-down. Then committed to reaching a goal, time is used “more efficiently” in a correction process that results in a new ability without the person realizing it (19). This process is the essence of deep practice.

To strengthen the above argumentation, Daniel Coyle refers to an authority in learning. According to the psychology professor Robert Bjork, the human brain is a “living structure, a scaffold of nearly infinite [sic] size” and not static (19). The difficulty of learning and the effort to fill the space between a craft that one wants to learn, and a skill one has, uncovers a gap that generates impulses, leading to increased scaffolding. Robert Bjork calls this gap the “sweet spot” (19).

Daniel Coyle loves details and uses two very comprehensive examples. One example is about a small plane simulator invented in the 1930s by Edwin Albert Link for flight training purposes. The Link Trainer with its visual feedback control system permitted pilots to practice take-offs, flying, and landing procedure exclusively by instruments. A pilot spend “hours inhabiting the sweet spot at the edge of his capabilities in ways he could never risk in an actual plane” (24).

## The devil is in the detail

The idea that every human being can attain a skill by investing energy in the right training and using helping devices (e.g. the flight trainer) is valid, I believe. Moreover, Daniel Coyle gives good arguments and compelling examples to explain the concept of deep practice.

Nevertheless, from an academic point of view there are weaknesses. For example, I miss a more thorough discussion of the traditional understanding of talent itself. Coyle reduces an argument to a footnote on page one. He writes: “In the interest of clarity, we’ll [sic] define talents in its strictest sense: the possession of repeatable skills that don´t depend on physical size […].”

It is clear that this is his definition. However, the Webster’s dictionary interprets talent in the following way: “the natural endowments of a person” or “a person of talent or a group of persons of talent in a field or activity.” The Oxford dictionary, on the other hand, elucidates much stricter: “natural aptitude or skill,” the traditional understanding.

Coyle criticizes the genetic predisposition, but he does not present any scientific results in this chapter. And was deep practice the only reason for the boost in flight abilities? Coyle mentions the political and economic pressures; flight accidents in storms and World War 2. On the other hand, he denies but does not evaluate the influence of innate, not necessarily genetic, factors, e.g. selective attention and intelligence (Stevens and Bevalier, 2012) or self-motivation.

Another weakness becomes apparent when reviewing the literature on similar aspects. A study by Lövden et. al. finds that in associative memory performance “age-group differences, and between-person differences among children and younger adults, increase as a function of extended adaptive practicing” (Lövden et. Al, 2012). Although the training procedure was not what Coyle describes as deep practice, differences in individual performance appear in this study, and Coyle does not consider it in general.

“The Sweet Spot” would have gained considerable in sweetness, had Coyle discussed and compared the concepts of natural talent (genius) and deep practice on the same level.

In contrast, he negates the traditional definition of talent in favor of his theory. Does he succeed in his mission? I have my doubt because Coyle does not directly contradict the possibility of an exceptional ability in a single individual. He discusses the achievement of skills by the many. Although, come to think of it. Was Edwin Albert Link not a gifted wizard?
