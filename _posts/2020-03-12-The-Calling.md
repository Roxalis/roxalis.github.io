After completing his thoughts, wing commander Fawcet, a tall man in his forties, glanced up from the report, played with his moustache, and heaved a sigh. Then he got up from his desk and left his room. He walked down the hall to group captain Macintosh’s office where he knocked on the door and waited for an answer which came rather harshly in the captain’s deep voice. Commander Fawcet opened the door.  
“Ah, the report! I’ll look into it soon enough,” said group captain Macintosh. “Now, we have to discuss the current situation. Central Command North has briefed me and ordered high alert. The situation is becoming more dangerous by the day. Like our British prime minister the president of the US has declined to discuss the vessel attack with the European Union any further. Instead, all divisions, and the air force in particular, are on high alert. It’s a dire situation, Fawcet!”   
“I see. What are your orders, sir?”   
“All time readiness. We will intensify our training schedule in shifts. Long distance bombardment flights are a priority. Brief your subordinates on the mission plans, will you?”   
“Yes, I’ll order a meeting right away, sir.”   
Wing commander Fawcet left the room swiftly and ordered his staff officer and all squadron leaders to a briefing. Everyone listened closely and left to carry out his orders.   

Squadron leader Forrester and commander Fawcet sat alone at a table in the officer’s canteen eating their dinner. Silently they finished their meals and left the building for the bar to have a drink. They stepped into the darkness and clear air that was freezing cold and calm. Without a word they walked towards the building housing the bar. The only sound was the noise from the snow under their shoes.    
The door in front of them opened and squadron leader Hulls, a small clear shaven man, appeared. “You need to come and see this.”   
The room was crowded but in complete silence. Men, looking either puzzled, embarrassed and smiling, or angry, gathered around an airman and watched him while he sat at the bar staring into the far distance. His eyes were wide open.   
“The lights!”   
“What lights?”, commander Fawcet asked.   
“The lights are so beautiful.”   
“What lights?”   
“The lights! So beautiful!” The airman’s face was sad.   
“Who is causing the lights?”   
The pilot peered at wing commander Fawcet, with eyes filled with tears. “So beautiful.”   
Then the airman got up from his stool and slowly left the bar. Commander Fawcet and other men followed him outside. The airman walked across the airbase towards the white expanse now in complete darkness. The others advised him to stay, and when they realised that the airman would walk out into the darkness, two men confronted him with the fact that he had to stop. But he did not budge and walked on. The men pushed him into a halt. He fell, sat there in the snow, and cried: “Let me go, oh please, let me go!” He got up and walked towards certain death, but four men grabbed him and carried him away. Commander Fawcet, Forrester, Hulls, and the other men went back to the bar to have their drinks. The pilot was forced in front of a psychiatrist.

“Another two men are missing, sir, airman Linsdell and Sergeant Lovely. The airman from last night, his name is Aubrey, is under close observation and we are waiting for a medical report,” said squadron leader Hulls, who was standing in front of wing commander Fawcet.   
“Since when have the two men been missing and what are the facts?” Commander Fawcet sat at his office table and glanced out of the window into the bright landscape waiting for Hulls answer.   
“Sergeant Lovely, a good and decent and atop of that a well-respected man, supervised the checkup and general maintenance of aircraft yesterday. Some staff said he looked worried or sad.  He left the hangar at around five p.m.. Nobody spoke to him after he had discharged himself from duty. He never returned and was not seen by anybody. The second man is airman Linsdell, sir. He was missing during the routine drill at 6 a.m. this morning, his bunk was empty, and some clothes missing. He must have walked out of the barrack during the night or early morning hours. Sir, my men searched the base but found neither Sergeant Lovely nor Linsdell.”   
“No notes? Sergeant Lovely seemed to be troubled about something.”   
“No, sir.”   
Wing commander Fawcet played with his moustache and looked searchingly at Hulls, then he starred through the window into the distance. “Send a team to look for any tracks in the snow at the perimeter of the base. Search for them, they might be still alive. Then write your report.”   
“Yes, sir.”    
Hulls turned on his feet and left the room while wing commander Fawcet returned to his work.   
Since the weather had been clear, Hulls’ team found two sets of traces protruding from the safe space of the base out into Greenland’s vastness. They found both missing men frozen to death a few miles outside the base. While neither men were wearing enough clothing, airman Linsdell was only wearing his track suit. With snowmobiles the lifeless bodies were transported back to base. There, the doctor performed a quick autopsy of both, which revealed nothing.

Jim Aubrey sat at a large table in front of Hulls, Forrester, and commander Fawcet. Aubrey’s eyes nervously glimpsed over his surroundings. Beside Aubrey sat the psychologist Dr. Simmons in his white coat with his report in front of him.   
“So, Dr. Simmons, what is your conclusion,” asked commander Fawcet.   
“Well, I think we are talking about schizophrenia with visual hallucinations and cognitive delusions. My patient experiences what he calls ‘the lights’ never in the inside of buildings, but outside during the day and at night. These visions are purely visual outside the base above the horizon. There are no hallucinatory voices or sounds, but ‘the lights’ evoke feelings. Maybe pilot Aubrey will explain.”   
“I—I feel them. The lights, I mean. They are warm and comforting. They are the answer to everything. When the lights are not there, I miss them deeply. But when the lights appear, I become happy and want to go where the lights are. But I can’t, I just can’t. Because of you I can’t.”   
The squadron leaders and wing commander Fawcet starred at the airman in discomfort. Dr. Simmons watched him with an examining distance and said, “Pilot Aubrey is attracted to those lights and has lost all appetite, and any normal needs are non-existent. Human desires have become irrelevant. He has stopped writing his wife and children. He has reduced contact with colleagues as much as possible. He needs close medical...”   
The door opened. Group captain Macintosh entered and yelled, “Fawcet, it has started! Get the men ready.”  
“Yes, sir!” All men except Aubrey were now standing. “Dr. Simmons, you will take the right measures. Get Aubrey out of our way,” ordered commander Fawcet.   
“Yes, sir.”   
Wing commander Fawcet turned to his squadron leaders. “Sound the alarm.”  
A few minutes later, the alarm put men into motion to do what they trained for. Men were called to their stations, and like machines the pilots dressed, boarded their planes equipped with maps and mission plans, and started the engines for takeoff, ready to destroy their targets.
