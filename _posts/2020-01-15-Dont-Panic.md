The Autumn sun beamed its bright light onto Staten Island. Martin had to raise one of his hands to shield his eyes, as he could barely see anything above the sidewalk. It was a Sunday morning, and, after staying with his friend Jacob over the weekend, Martin had promised his mother he would be back home for lunch at noon. He ran to get the 11:23 o’clock bus and while Martin ran, the S57 bus passed him. The boy was nervous and sprinted as fast as he could since in case the boy missed that bus and came too late his parents would be furious. The bus stopped and a few people entered it while a Native American exited. He smiled at Martin. Then the bus sped away. “Oh no,” Martin cried out. “The day is ruined,” he thought and sat down onto a bench beside the bus stop, glanced to the ground, and kicked at the tiny stones lying to his feet.

“Want a ride?” a guy with sunglasses called out through the opened passenger window of a dark blue BMW. Martin got up and plodded to the car. 

“Cornell street is where I live, sir. Next to Forest Avenue Shoppers Town. Will you pass it?” 

The man lowered his sunglasses, and now Martin saw his incredibly blue eyes. “We’ll make it happen, kid. Get in.” 

The man started the engine and Martin put on his seat belt. Inside the car it smelled of leather mixed with coffee and plastic. Martin looked around. Black leather covered the seats, and the manufacturer had made the dashboard of black skin. Everything was clean. The man, who Martin guessed to be in his forties, wore a shiny shirt with silvery light blue tie, black trousers, black mitts, and a large silver digital watch. “Are you engaged in sports?” the man asked while driving.

“I play football at school.”

“What’s your favorite position, attack or defense?”

“Defense.”

“Ah, I thought so,” the man responded and unbuttoned his sleeves and rolled them slowly up to his elbows. Martin was surprised to discover tattoos on the man’s strong arms. His left arm exposed a large eye and an ornament in many colors. On his right arm a colorful snake ate what looked like a frog. Martin stared. The man noticed this and said, “It’s a San Francisco Garter Snake; a rare species.” The man smiled and asked: “What’s your name?” 

“Martin.”

“How old are you?”

“Thirteen, fourteen in September, sir.”

“Martin. Like Martin Luther King, eh?”

“He was a hero.”

“Well, you’ve got his color, kiddo, that’s for sure.” The man’s face turned serious. “Want to listen to some music?” After Martin’s approval the man turned on the radio. A radio host talked about a music festival in Brooklyn. The man pushed a few buttons and stopped as Barry Manilow sang Schubert’s Ave Maria. Out of the blue, the fellow started singing but it was grotesque. The man waved his arms about; he bent his head backward, closed his eyes, and opened his mouth in dramatization. Martin grew uneasy, giggled nervously, and studied the man’s wristwatch. It was now 11:32. Martin looked at the buildings, signs, street lamps, and pedestrians passing by. He then noticed that instead of driving straight on the man turned right onto Victory Boulevard. “The fastest way is over Bradley Avenue,” Martin suggested.

“I know, but I want to show you something.” 

The man grinned—showing his upper and lower teeth. He changed the radio channel to pop music and later turned left onto a narrow road heading into the Clove Lake Park. Beeches, birches, elms, maples, and oaks grew densely on both sides of the vehicle. The man steered the BMW through a curvature, then over a small bridge. After a few minutes he parked the car at a spot from where the two were able to look at the Saint Peter’s Cemetery on the right. “Nice quiet place, ain’t it?” The man did not wait for an answer. “Somewhere among those stones the bones of Forrest Baker rest. Have you heard of him, kiddo?” He took off his sunglasses and put them in his shirt’s side pocket.

“No.”

“He expired on his way to school in 2009. That boy was up to no good.”

“You knew him?” 

The man laughed. “I know them all,” he said and continued to laugh. Martin became restless. He had the impulse to open the door and leave, but curiosity stopped him. 

“How did you meet them?”

“Just like you, kiddo, just like you. On the way home, to a friend, or to the cinema; on so many opportunities.” 

The man now stared at Martin and beamed. “Let me tell you of another example. Tommie Weisbecker from Ohio, a blond little fellow, was on his way to mum and dad. I asked him, if he liked an ice. Works most of the time. Kids love ice cream in the summer. He ate his ice, and I later ate his soul.” He chuckled.  “Some tramper later found the boy in a ditch next to Interstate 75. Then there was…” He continued to speak of terrible incidences while his eyes receded into the sockets and turned yellowish-green. The tissue of his face lost its color, and rancid air filled the vehicle. His voice became darker. With the seat belt still on, Martin pulled the handle to open the passenger door, but it did not budge. He tried again and again and harder. The door would not open. Never in his life had Martin been so scared. His palms were wet, his whole body was sweating, and he felt the cold air. The inside of the BMW was chilling.

“No use in trying, kiddo. Child safety-ha-ha. Your soul is mine.” The creature’s horrid face was serious, and its hand reached for the glove compartment, opened it, and took out a dagger. Martin stopped any movement. He wished he could sink his body far into the seat and disappear. Tears started to accumulate in his eyes. “Although it’s useless, most of the others struggle. They scream or at least try to bite.” It paused for a moment. “Here is a deal: I will ask you a question, a riddle, and if you answer correctly, then you are free to go.” 

“OK,” Martin whispered.

“Perfect. A prince tells everyone the court jester lies. The court jester tells everyone that the king lies. The king, however, tells everyone that both the prince and the court jester lie. Who is telling the truth?” 

Martin asked the creature to repeat the riddle, which it did. It took Martin about half a minute to consider different possibilities, then he gave the answer to an astonished and disappointed looking entity. 
“The court jester. If the prince lies, the court jester tells the truth. That means the king is a liar. The king says the prince and court jester both tell lies. This is false. For the statement, the king being a liar, to be true, it is enough to assume that either the prince or the court jester is telling the truth. Here the prince and the king lie, and the court jester tells the truth.” Martin felt both relieved and confident. 

“Correct, I’m afraid. You saved yourself there, kiddo.” It put back the dagger, opened the window, started the engine, and regained its prior appearance. It was now 11:48.

The entity drove the quickest route to Martin’s home and both were silent. It parked the vehicle at the corner of Cornell Street and Barrett Avenue, stepped out of the BMW, walked to Martin’s side, and opened the passenger door. When Martin got up from his seat the boy noticed that he was shaky on his legs and his pants were wet. “We won’t hear from each other again,” said the creature and touched Martin on the shoulder, walked to the driver’s side, and waved its left hand three times while entering the car. The creatures’s tattoos disappeared and it morphed into someone else. When it drove off the bodywork of the dark blue BMW changed into a green Chevrolet. 

The entity could not have known that Martin was one of the friendly children out there and also had won an award in a statewide math competition. Logic was his favorite subject. The boy trudged back home and arrived at 11:59. His parents and his sister and brother were waiting for him. “The day is not ruined,” Martin told them and laughed wholeheartedly.
