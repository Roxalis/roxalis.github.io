I

On a sunny and mild Saturday late afternoon my older brother Pete and I passed a graveyard on the right and then the Gray Baptist church on the left. We drove the pickup off Cumberland Gap Parkway onto the appliance dump and unloaded the washing machine that Pete had offered a colleague to dispose of. I glanced over the site. Other than dense woods to the north and surrounding high grass, there was no flora. The ground was a mixture of yellow-orange sand and dirt. People had demolished appliances randomly and covered them with graffiti. On a fridge some one had written, “Jim Beam was here.” I went for a stroll in this lonely place and, suddenly, saw it obscured behind a small hill. The mattress looked new and clean and was wrapped in plastic. After removing the elastic cover, I took a deep breath. It had a lovely rose scent. “Perfect,” I thought. “Who’d dump such a nice mattress,” I asked my brother. He shrugged. Pete and I loaded it onto the truck, then we took the highway to London where Pete’s wife Jill cooked us a meal.

After dinner, I drove my pickup back to Lexington and arrived an hour later. Our house is a one-story five-room home in a quiet and friendly neighborhood, built of red brick with a large back garage, a blue front door, and a big lawn. After my mother had died, my girlfriend Marion and I renovated our new home, therefore the interior now has a different touch: new appliances, only a few pictures and simple, practical furniture.  
I parked the truck in the garage and carried the mattress into the house. Marion was in the kitchen reading the Lexington Herald. “Is everything fine?” she asked.  
“Yes. Let me show you something.”  
I took her hand, and she followed me along the hall to our new asset. The mattress now looked older, since, resting against the wall, its fabric cover showed early signs of a crease.  
“What’s that,” she asked in a surprised way.  
“What does it look like? I found it on a dump site, must be new.”  
“Is it, if some one trashed it?”  
“We need a fresh mattress and this one’s perfect.”  
“Is it?”   
She glanced at me critically. She was beautiful and wore black pumps, a blue silk dress hiding her bruised body, and a silver necklace and earrings. She had combed her blond hair into a pigtail. Her dark brown eyes stared at the mattress. Then her left eyelid twitched. “But if I find a spot or a trace of stink, you’ll trash it and buy a new one, right?”  
We removed the bedding from my parents’ old noisy mattress. Time to get rid of the ghosts, we joked. Before we slept on the other mattress Marion did a thorough inspection. As its cover was flawless, silvery white, maybe damask, with floral sprigs, and as its interior did its work soundlessly, she approved. Then we went to sleep.

After an uneventful Sunday, we retired to bed early, since we had to get up first in the morning.    
At 2:33, a deep and dull sound under my head awakened me. Marion was fast asleep. To find out if the mattress had caused the odd noise, I swung around, moved the cushion aside, and squeezed that spot — nothing. I turned onto my back to face the pitch blackness of our bedroom, and after an indefinite time I fell asleep.    
“Where is she?” A woman in her thirties looked at me. Brown and dark yellow freckles dotted her plump, white face. And a tear ran down her left cheek. When she opened her thin lipped mouth, rotting teeth showed, and her green eyes moved swiftly to the right and left. “Oh, my sweetheart. How?” Her breath was sour and the red hair for days unwashed. Again she gawked at me with an unhappy glare. I noticed the sweat in my palms and the stiffness in my body. She reached out to touch me. “Are you…”    
Marion and I had an early breakfast and made small-talk. Afterwards we drove to work. As a site manager, I supervised the development of a few new houses in Lexington, and Marion sold jewellery at a small boutique. Throughout the day, I had an uneasy feeling. The dream had been so vivid, unlike any other. The same day I finished work early at five-thirty. “What’s going on? Are you troubled?” Marion was restless, because we had invited guests for 7 p.m., and prepared dinner.   
“It’s nothing,” I replied.   
“I had a nightmare.”   
“We all have bad dreams once in a while.”   
She smiled and gave me a kiss on the cheek. “Have a drink, it’ll relax you.” There were moments where I hated her rationalizing.  
The visitors left after dinner, and we retired soon. Since I was nervous, I got up, sneaked into the next door living room, and read a magazine. An hour later, I heard the dull sound coming from the bedroom. Thumb. This time the noise was much louder. Somewhat hesitant, I trudged towards the bedroom, and, anew, I heard the sound, but this time quieter. I entered the room. The corridor light shimmered across the floor and into the garden. Marion was sleeping. The sound emitted a third time from the bed. Thump. I stopped there one or two minutes, mystified and apprehensive. Then I saw something moving in the corner of my eye and looked towards it. Behind the window was the woman from last night. She stared and smiled at me for a long time. How misplaced, I thought, when I realized three white rabbits had been sewed onto her pink, disheveled T-shirt. I glanced at her red shoulder-length hair and then at her neck. Something was terribly amiss. Before I could discern what it was, she turned around and walked into the dark.

The next day, it was a cloudy Tuesday morning, I sat in the kitchen, undressed, unshaven, and tired. Marion entered the room, and she asked in astonishment: “What is wrong with you?”    
“I could not sleep the whole night. There is something wrong with the mattress.”   
“Something wrong with the mattress. You should listen to yourself, Philip. What’s awry about it?” She burst out in laughter.   
“If it’s not the mattress, then it’s me,” I thought and pondered.   
“Whatever,” Marion said. She got her clothes, went to the bathroom to take her morning shower, and did her makeup. Still confused by last night’s experience, I remained in the kitchen for an hour. Then I showered to remove the discomfort, meanwhile Marion had left, and afterwards I had breakfast. At the same time, I sifted through the phone book to find a psychologist to consult. A few calls later, I spoke to Dr. Beardsley, a neurologist from the Eastern State Hospital, and asked him if realistic hallucinations could appear spontaneous without a cause.   
“Not likely. Many forms of psychosis cause hallucinations. For example substance misuse, epilepsy, delirium, or other medical conditions such as an impairment of the visual system. Then there is schizophrenia, a mental disorder prevalent in childhood or early adulthood that leads to visual and acoustic hallucinations. People with this condition need treatment. Do you have any hallucinations, Mr Morgan?”   
“No, I’m calling on behalf of my son who writes a school report,” I lied, said goodbye, and hung up the phone.   
I worked late and arrived home at about 11:30 p.m. Marion was still up and reading. She smiled.   
“Hungry?”   
“No, thanks. I had a burger at A&W.”    
“How was work?”    
“A little tense. All the constructions, you know. Things will calm down eventually.”   
“We need to talk. You have acted strangely. Are you worried? What’s on your mind?”   
“I’m fine. Really.” I kissed her on the mouth. Her lips were soft and wet; I took off my clothes. Then I noticed the dull sound again. Thump. I saw her bruises, green and blue, extending from her breast to her right shoulder.   
“What’s wrong,” she asked.   
“I can’t. I’m sorry.”   
“Ok, then let’s just sleep.”   
She turned towards the window and pulled the bedcover over her shoulder. After closing the bedroom door, I drew the curtains, fell into bed, and switched off the light.  
A stench of decay woke me up. A young girl laughed, and a woman moaned. I struggled to see something in the blackness and the smell was overwhelming. I switched on the bed light. A child cross-legged on the floor under the window giggled as she watched Marion sleep, while four women, standing at the end of the bed, glared at me. One of them I knew, she was the one I had seen last night. The other four I had never seen before. They had three features in common — a slight-build, reddish hair, and death. One of them tried to speak. I could barely look at her. Dried blood was in her hair, on her left forehead, and neck, down to her jeans. Her right blue eye with many small veins looked at the ceiling. Her left eye watched me. She opened and closed her mouth, but her lower jaw was dislocated and the syllables incomprehensible.    
The grinning child must have been in her teens, shoulder-length auburn hair, T-shirt, jeans, bare dirty feet, yellowish-white complexion, but an innocent looking face with lots of freckles. When she noticed the attention, she turned her head towards me, and her black eyes stared at me. Obviously the pupils were dilated. I grew even more uncomfortable, and a woman with curly red hair and green eyes said: “You’re lucky.” I now noticed that the speaking person was half naked. The only thing she wore was a dirty sweater and a necklace: no pants, no socks, no shoes. Transparent liquid trickled down her legs; the stink of urine began to mix with the other stench. “You and that rich bitch of yours,” a tattooed blue-eyed woman in a sweatshirt and jeans said. She was the only one who had reddish-blond hair. The child giggled. I was nervous and looked at Marion. She was still sleeping. “We wander on thin ice. The everyday effort and the next minute it’s over,” the woman in the T-shirt with the white rabbits said. For a moment a vicious smile crossed her face. “You got yourself a precious item there,” the tattooed woman said with a smile and pointed with her pink fingernails at the bed. The child started weeping.  
“Why is the light on? What are you doing?” I caught Marion’s eyes, turned my head, lifted my arm, and pointed at the intruders, but they had vanished. The terrible odor had gone. I crawled to the edge of the bed. The carpet was dry, and I noticed something lying where the girl had been sitting. “What’s the knife doing here, Philip?” Marion was furious and confused, so I told her to calm down and sit in the living room. I pulled away the bedding and inspected the mattress. I swung it on its back and examined the seam — it had a different color.    Confident that the knife was one of our kitchen knives, I cut the stitching and removed the fabric top, then the middle upholstery and finally the comfort layer. Bewildered by what I discovered, I called the cops.

A few weeks later I sat in a room that had no windows. The linoleum was dark grey and the walls a light green. On the table right next to the wall rested an inactive tape recorder. Agent Ross from the Federal Bureau of Investigation sat opposite me. “Mr Morgan, it’s been a while now, and we have investigated the things you found in the mattress. You’re not a suspect. I want to reassure you of this.”    
“Ok.”    
“Your and your partner’s DNA are not among the jewellery and underwear. We just started the inquiry, we are positive, however, that we have one male suspect, who we identified in our DNA database, and five female victims. The blood on one panty matches a Jane Doe in Tennessee. He bludgeoned her to death. The DNA of another unidentified body, which we found strangled here in Kentucky, was on the jewellery cleverly packed into the encased coils of the mattress.”   
“He must have had a good night’s sleep.”   
Agent Ross smiled. Bending over, he pushed two photos across the table. A peek at the deceased on the pictures was enough for a lifetime, and I recognized the red hair, the freckles, and the pink T-shirt with the rabbits. “Your partner said there had been an instance of domestic violence, but she hasn’t filed a complaint. Can you explain?”   
“No…I mean…It won’t happen again, I promise.” I was tired and ashamed.
Agent Ross picked up his notes, the pictures, and the report. On his way out he turned around and said: “We’ll see.” Then he left the room.
