## The Precision Game

From in-vivo study to in-vitro test:  
I’m on a quest to seek and aim for the hit  
&#8212; a multitude.  

No lord in white will help.  

I’m expensive. I mix matter,  
Armed with a pipette and knowledge;  

Let me unearth the blind spot  
In one, in two, and three dimensions.  

A fluke or random gift I don’t seek,  
But a volition’s path beyond the maze. 

## Contact

A small man walked towards 'Departures'.  
A tall, confident blonde with unknown destination  
Asked him something &#8212; without inhibition.  
He stopped and turned 180 degrees to face her body;  
He expressed grotesque, deliberate gestures.   
With purported friendliness and without a smile  
The man then replied the inaudible. 

## Topography

While watching Switzerland, the day had dawned above  
A patchwork: distant mountains, fields, and trees.  
Landscape, overshadowed by her beauty;  
Pure, pierced, and tanned she slept.  
I, blinded, closed my eyes  
farewell  
&#8212;   

## Stars

I

A star had left perilous traces.  
Like a black shadow it bends above him.  
Words, which he now repents, are among  
The dead. Bullets and knives  
Gagged them into silence.   

He was safe in room № 12, yet  
The air was heavy and he battled,  
Dread and agony choked him  
Like a brazen bull.  

No doubt, the star left treacherous spaces;   
The unknown triggered much of his fear.   
Thoughts, to others illogical, in this web,  
This thread of illusions, like spider’s venom   
Melted his guts for its feast.  

II

A rainbow touches tenderly   
The mountain’s snowy peak.  
And among heaven's silk  
Self-righteous men cackle  
At a hopeful guest.  

She gives them no ease.  
Under the sun’s warm beams  
She glides upon the frozen wave.  
Then she stretches her spine;  
She caresses her short, thick hair  
While others nearby tattle.   

There exists a star of solace;   
She thinks of it.  
Now she’s in room № 3,  
And a smile’s a gift among sisters.  
Resoluteness is the golden key  
In this blue stream of reinvigoration.    

## Venus boy

An open heart: their words had torn his world  
Apart; and wasps can kill ten bees an hour.  
He thus had curled his hair to their accord.    
Helpless, wretched, and fearful he is.  

Projections now outrun the fastest horse,  
And time-space riddles speak out  
From the core; an open crypt.   
Her eyes' tears grow a sea.  

Venus Boy, a pleasure trigger!  
With him true love will beg to be  
On her, with him, for her;  
On him, with her, for him.  
Love’s but a pessimist &#8212; 

## Painting nails

First one and then two.  
First pink and then blue.   
I say: the genesis of ten.  
First pink, then blue.  
Neither plastic, nor glue.  
First one, then two.  
Itchy, twirly, witchy.  
Itchy, twirly, witchy.  
Olé!
