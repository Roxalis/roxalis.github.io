Dear Ms.,

thank you for your interest in visiting Florida for rehabilitation. Mr. Wright, a Jefferson Ranger, has told me about your inquiry and has kindly written this letter. I’m a horse fly and writing is not something I do frequently...

My mother laid 356 eggs on a stone near Lake Miccosukee in Jefferson, Florida. My generation hatched after only a week, so my mother told me. As larvae we crawled onto the wet soil and then into the water to feast on small worms and insects for a few weeks; some got such an appetite they cannibalised on brothers and sisters - we grew intensely. Then, about six weeks later, I moved to drier soil to pupate inside a self-made mud cylinder and hatched fully grown. Since then I’ve been very busy searching for nectar and pollen, which provides us with nutrients for body energy consumption. We avoid open areas with intense sunlight, and, instead, favour shady patch-shape flora complexity. So most of the time you will find us near dirt paths and on the edges of forests.

There is something important you should know about us. We flies have evolved for more than 250 million years. Today, over 188 fly families and 158 thousand known species, an estimated one million, inhabit this planet. What sets us true flies apart from most other flying insects are two hind wings that have developed into a pair of small flight balancing organs, leaving two instead of four wings and an enlarged centre body segment, filled with strong flight muscles. These evolutionary changes have permitted us to become flight athletes: we can fly backwards, vertical, and hover like the British Harrier Jump Jet!

We flies also exhibit characteristic large sucking mouthparts and special drainage canals for efficient fluid intake. Have you ever watched a hungry house fly suck at some sugary liquid on the kitchen table? I’m sure you have. However, other flies use specialised mouthparts to bite large mammals, little mosquitoes for example. But the most interesting biting species are large tsetse, deer flies, and we, the horse flies.

Following mating and fertilisation, which our species does in midair, like bees, we males die shortly after. I’m sure we’ll return to the ‘place’ we were before birth, so death does not scare me at all.

Females, on the other hand, live on for a while and search for blood. The offspring needs it. Blood is an important nutrition for the eggs that grow inside our mothers. The volume of internalised blood ranges from a single drop to, well, more or less the lower range of a human blood test.

We are attracted to large animals with uniform colouring and respond to carbon dioxide in animal breath, and also to particular species’ odour and urine. Humans themselves become victims of bites — some intensely agonising. Preferably, we bite into the legs, the back, head and shoulders, the face. Therefore, I would strongly advise you not to visit county Jefferson in the summertime.

With kind regards!
