Dear Ms,

thank you for your interest in visiting Florida for rehabilitation. Mr Wright, a Jefferson Ranger, has told me about your inquiry and has kindly written this letter for me. I’m a horse fly and writing is not something I do very often.

 My mother laid 356 eggs on a stone near Lake Miccosukee in Jefferson, Florida. My generation hatched after only a week, so my mother told me. As larvae we crawled onto the mud and then into the water to feast on small worms and insects for a few weeks; some got such an appetite they cannibalized on brothers and sisters — we grew intensely. Then, six weeks later, I moved to drier soil to pupate inside a self-made mud cylinder and after one or two months hatched fully grown. Since then, I’ve been very busy searching for nectar and pollen, which provides us with nutrients for body energy consumption. We avoid open areas with intense sunlight and favor shady patch-shape flora complexity. Most of the time you will find us near dirt paths and on the edges of forests.

 There is something important you should know about us. We flies have evolved for over 250 million years. Today, over 188 fly families and 158 thousand known species inhabit this planet. What sets us flies apart from most other flying insects are two hind wings that have developed into a pair of small flight balancing organs, leaving two instead of four wings and an enlarged center body segment filled with strong flight muscles. These evolutionary changes permitted us to become athletes: we can fly backwards, vertical, and hover like the British Harrier Jump Jet!

 We flies also show characteristic large sucking mouthparts and special drainage canals for adequate fluid intake. Have you ever watched a hungry house fly suck at sugary liquid on the kitchen table? I’m sure you did. However, other flies use specialized mouths to bite mammals, little mosquitoes for example. But the most interesting biting species are tsetse, deer flies, and we, the horse flies.

 Following mating and fertilization, which our species does in midair like the bee, we males die shortly after this. I’m sure we’ll return to the ‘place’ we were before birth, so death does not scare me. Females live on for a while and search for blood. The offspring needs it. Blood is an important nutrition for the eggs that grow inside our mothers. The volume of internalized blood ranges from a single drop to, well, more or less the lower range of a human blood test. Large animals attract us with their uniform coloring and we respond to carbon dioxide in the breath, and to the particular species’ odor and urine. Humans themselves become victims of bites — some agonizing. Preferably, we bite into the legs, the back, head and shoulders, and the face. So I strongly recommend you not to visit county Jefferson in the summer.

 With kind regards!
