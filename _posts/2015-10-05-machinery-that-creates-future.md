The unfolded protein responds (UPR), discovered in the 1970s and 1980s, is an evolutionarily preserved cell signaling program in both single-cell and multicellular organisms. Two sub-cellular structures are involved: the nucleus and the endoplasmatic reticulum.

The nucleus is a kind of central data storage and interactive pre-processing system for the synthesis of proteins. At this site, enzymes activate the genetic information, copy it into mRNA molecules, change, and move it outside the nucleus for protein synthesis.

The endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) comprises a membrane network surrounding the nucleus that enables folding or unfolding and assembly or disassembly of proteins. Animal cells produce specialized proteins to communicate with the environment.  These signaling proteins play a crucial part during cell division, cell movement, differentiation into distinct cell types, and cell death.

The ER releases folded proteins. Accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins leads to an increase in the ER structure and enhances protein degradation. In case of such ER stress, the decision to start cell death depends on whether the ER can reestablish a balance fast enough. If the ER fails, then this activates the unfolded protein responds - a dysfunction that may cause diabetes and cancer.

Peter Walter (Jefferey Cox) and Kazutoshi Mori independently discovered Ire1, a protein mediator of the UPR, in yeast in the early nineties. Ire1 is evolutionary old and thanks to many yeast studies the best understood UPR protein. In reaction to ER stress, Ire1 drives the entire gene expression. It remains unclear, however, if a single or multiple mechanisms start the UPR.

In higher organisms Ire1, PERK and ATF6 are the only known signal pathway initiating factors to date. Their joint action establishes a balance in the ER by strengthening protein folding and by starting the removal of misfolded ER proteins. But Ire1, PERK and ATF6 also cause cell death. How these proteins regulate the cell fate dualism is poorly understood.

Kazutoshi Mori and his team identified ATF6 in the late 1990s - believing it to be a single soluble gene activating factor.  When Mori et. al. later treated mammalian cells with the UPR-inducing substance Tunicamycin, levels of ATF6 decreased and a smaller fragment appeared. To their surprise, the blocking of overall protein synthesis showed that AFT6 splits into two proteins;  ATF6 degrades and as a result ATF6-N remains.

ATF6's amino acid composition was typical for membrane proteins: it included a water-repellent amino acid sequence and hinted at protein glycosylation. With this information the group tested cells treated with glycosylation-removing enzyme and with specific membrane protein releasing substances. Finally, they analyzed the cellular localization of stained ATF6 in comparison with other known proteins.

The scientists perceived ATF6 as being a single soluble gene activator then an ER membrane-bound stress sensor. Under ER stress enzymes cleave ATF6. Resulting ATF6-N is then translocated into the cell nucleus where it activates quality control genes and the UPR.

In his autobiography the 1965 Nobel Laureate Francois Jacob, who deciphered the control of enzyme and virus synthesis with André Lwoff and Jacques Monot, described scientific day-to-day activity as a “hellish rhythm. A race with no end. More important than the answers were the questions, and the way they are raised because - at best - the answers lead inevitably to new questions. An incubator of hope. Machinery to create future.”
