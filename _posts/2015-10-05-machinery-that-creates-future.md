The unfolded protein responds (UPR), discovered in the 1970s and 1980s, is an evolutionarily preserved cell signaling program in both single-cell and multicellular organisms. The program involves two sub-cellular structures: the nucleus and the endoplasmatic reticulum.

The nucleus represents a kind of central data storage and interactive preprocessing system for the synthesis of proteins. At this site, the genetic information is activated, copied into mRNA molecules, modified, and relocated outside the nucleus for protein synthesis.

The endoplasmatic reticulum (ER) consists of a membrane network surrounding the nucleus, which enables folding or unfolding as well as assembly or disassembly of proteins. Animal cells produce specialized proteins to communicate with the environment.  These signaling proteins play a crucial part during cell division, cell movement, the differentiation into distinct cell types, and cell death.

The ER normally releases folded proteins. The accumulation of unfolded or misfolded proteins leads, however, to an increase in the ER structure and enhances protein degradation. In case of such ER stress, the decision to initiate cell death depends on whether the ER is able to reestablish a balance fast enough. If the ER fails, then the unfolded protein responds is activated - a dysfunction that may result in diabetes and cancer.

Peter Walter (Jefferey Cox) and Kazutoshi Mori independently discovered Ire1, a protein mediator of the UPR, in yeast in the early nineties. Ire1 is evolutionary old and thanks to many yeast studies the best understood UPR protein. In reaction to ER stress, Ire1 drives the entire gene expression. It remains unclear, however, if the UPR is initiated by a single or multiple mechanisms.

In higher organisms Ire1, PERK and ATF6 are the only known signal pathway initiating factors to date. Their combined action establishes a balance in the ER by strengthening protein folding and by initiating the removal of misfolded ER proteins. But Ire1, PERK and ATF6 also cause cell death. How these proteins regulate the cell fate dualism is poorly understood.

Kazutoshi Mori and his team identified ATF6 in the late 1990s - believing it to be a single soluble gene activating factor.  When Mori et. al. later treated mammalian cells with the UPR-inducing substance Tunicamycin, levels of ATF6 decreased and a smaller fragment appeared. To their surprise, the blocking of overall protein synthesis revealed that AFT6 splits into two proteins;  ATF6 degrades and as a result ATF6-N remains.

ATF6's amino acid composition was typical for membrane proteins: it included a water-repellent amino acid sequence and hinted at protein glycosylation. With this information the team tested cells treated with glycosylation-removing enzyme and with specific membrane protein releasing substances. Finally, they visually analyzed the cellular localization of stained ATF6 in comparison with other known proteins.

The perception of ATF6 changed from a single soluble gene activator into an ER membrane-bound stress sensor. Under ER stress, ATF6 is cleaved. Resulting ATF6-N then translocates into the cell nucleus where it activates quality control genes and thereby the UPR.

In his autobiography the 1965 Nobel Laureate Francois Jacob, who deciphered the control of enzyme and virus synthesis with André Lwoff and Jacques Monot, described scientific activity as a “hellish rhythm. A race with no end. More important than the answers were the questions, and the way they are raised because - at best - the answers lead inevitably to new questions. An incubator of hope. Machinery to create future.”
