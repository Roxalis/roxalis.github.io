The black Ford moved at ninety-three miles an hour along Highway 80. Outside the vehicle the vast Nevada desert stretched along the horizon. Inside it was hot and the air was stale. Gary, the driver, watched the road and smiled while Faith, a small and charming girl with a sour expression, sat next to him with her feet on the dash. For the last hour they had talked little. Suddenly it burst out of Faith like an erupting volcano.  
“You did it again!” Faith cried.  
“I did what?”  
“You ruined everything!”  
“What are you talking about?”  
“You know what it’s about.” Tears dropped from her cheeks.  
Gary was angry. The needle on the speedometer went to zero and the car stopped beside the highway. “What’s your problem, babe?”  
“Don’t call me babe. I had it. You did it again. I had it!”  
“What the fuck are you talking about?”  
“Oh, really! What’s her name…Kelli?”  
“So what?”  
“You and Kelli!”  
“No, no, no.” Gary wiggled his finger in front of Faith’s face. She laughed hysterically.  
“You're such a bad fucking lier!”  
“Babe, I promise! There’s nothing’appening between me and Kelli.”  
“I know, Gary! I fucking know all of it. Tom told me.”  
A bright smile crossed Gary’s face. He unfastened his seatbelt and then slapped Faith’s face with his left hand. She cried out loud, moved her head to the right, and raised her arms to protect her pretty face. Smeared make-up had turned it into misery. And Gary? Gary changed the gear, drove the vehicle back onto the road, and mumbled “Nothing happened.”

Under the shadows of the pine tree forest two policemen moved effortlessly up a hill. Both men had backpacks, and the officer was carrying a .22 rifle over his shoulder. They were of similar small and heavy build and seen from afar one could have identified them as twins were it not for sergeant Richard Miller’s large grey moustache and the overall difference in age. That morning was the beginning of a warm summer day and in the shadows the dry air was cool and inhabited by mosquitoes, black flies, and other flying insects. The air was so clean that a smell was hardly detectable, only the faint scent of soil and pine aroma.  
“What’s your wife Tracy doing this weekend?”, Richard Miller asked.  
“She’ll do yoga with her friend Carrol.”  
“I met Carrol in the parking lot of Foster’s in Sweet Home the other day.”  
“There is also the party at Carmen Burns in 42nd Avenue, so she’ll have a great time.”  
“You mean, compared to us—ha—ha!”  
“No, we’ll have a great time, too, dad.”  
“An exciting adventure!”  
Richard Miller had been a police officer for twenty-two years and has become a sergeant ten years ago. His son, Bob Miller, went to police academy and then started to work at the same police station. That was three years ago. Before deciding to become a police officer, Bob had been a plumber at the age of twenty-three and had had a few odd jobs. He drank too much and going to the police academy has helped him straighten out his life.   
They stopped for a moment while sergeant Richard Miller checked his GPS, searched their position on a map, and said,  “We’re not far off the place Mr. Sexton talked about.” He pointed in one direction. “It’s up this way and behind the hill near a stream.” Officer Bob Miller followed him further up the hill. Suddenly he put his hand onto his father’s shoulder and gave him a sign to crouch.

Gary and Faith had known each other since childhood. They had been friends in elementary school, but after that their paths diverged until many years later they met on a party in the suburbs of Los Angeles. They fell for each other. Both were attractive and young and optimistic. Faith loved Gary’s silly humor and Gary loved Faith’s beautiful smile. There were many wonderful reasons for an engagement, but Gary and Faith wanted to take things slowly. They moved into a small flat in downtown LA where they lived together for five years. Then Faith got a job offer in Salt Lake City — an offer she could not resist — and, after moving to Salt Lake, the relationship grew dim. Gary found a job in his profession as a car mechanic, but Faith earned twice as much as a secretary for the company that sold metal detectors. Gary was envious. And Gary — being an attractive youthful man with a solid build — grew interested in other women. However, Faith could not let go of Gary, and neither could Gary separate from Faith.  
“I want you to turn around, Gary.”  
“No, I promised Jill and her family we will visit.”  
“But look at me! I can’t show up like this and I’m leaving you, Gary,” she cried.  
“You won’t dare, I love you.”  
“And Kelli?”  
“I don’t love Kelli, I love you.”  
“You’re crazy!”  
Gary concentrated on the road and speed of the vehicle. Then he noticed his thirst.  
“We need something to drink. I’ll take the next truck stop where you can clean your face while I fill’er up.”  
They reached a TA truck stop with a petrol station, a shopping mall, and a family restaurant. Gary parked the car in front of one of the gasoline pumps and both got out of the vehicle. Faith walked to the bathroom as fast as she could, but this did not prevent a truck driver from being sympathetic. “Look at you. Are you ok?”, he asked. Faith walked on and ignored the man. By the time Gary had finished filling the tank and paying for the gasoline, Faith had cleaned her face and put on make-up. They then decided to have something to eat, and so he drove in front of the restaurant and parked the car.

“Is it Big Foot?”, Richard Miller whispered.  
Bob Miller raised his rifle and aimed for something, but his father got hold of the barrel and pulled it to the ground.   
“What in God’s name are you doing, son?”  
“It’s a deer! There, look,” and he pointed into the direction of a large stag.  
“And what will you do with it once you successfully killed it? Leave it to rot?”  
“We could cut it up and take a few pieces home, dad.”  
“That’s not our job. We’re not here for hunting game. Mr. Sexton, remember?” Richard Miller touched Bob’s shoulder.  
Bob Miller was disappointed and his more experienced father sympathetic, but Richard Miller knew to set the right priorities and their goal was to find the place that had unsettled Mr. Sexton on his hunting spree two days ago. He had called the police station and had talked to Richard Miller in a shaky voice, very unlike Mr. Sexton. Richard Miller had visited and questioned him about what he had seen, but it was too terrible to describe and it needed professional attention, Mr. Sexton had said. That was all Richard Miller and his son knew.  
Bob Miller reluctantly followed his father up the hill, and the stag disappeared. They reached the peak of the hill where they had their breakfast. The view from up there was immense and beautiful; trees as far as one could see and a blue sky without a cloud. A slight haze covered the Blue Mountains in the far north-east. After they had eaten their sandwiches, they walked down the hill towards the valley, a place they dreaded, and father and son remained silent in anticipation of what they would discover down in the valley which stretched from east to west. They came upon an extensive field of grass and the stream that Richard Miller had mentioned. To Bob Miller, the water seemed like an invisible barrier. They crossed the stream and walked into the field.

Gary and Faith entered the restaurant and took a seat next to the windows. The restaurant was empty except for a couple with two children and a man at the counter. The waitress, a corpulent woman with a big smile, came to take the order.   
“What can I bring you?”  
“Two burgers with fries and coffee, please,” Faith responded. After the waitress had left Faith said to Gary, “We need to talk.”  
“Talk about what?”  
“Us?”  
“What’s there to talk about? Nothing has changed.”  
Faith was still upset. “Oh, yes, a lot has changed.”  
“And whose fault is that?”  
“You had all these affairs, not me!”  
“They didn’t mean much to me, you know that.”  
The waitress came and brought the food and coffee. Gary paid and gave the woman a large extra tip. Again she beamed, the smile that softens any man’s heart.  
“Let’s get engaged! Or married, let’s skip the engagement.”
“Whoa, babe. You’re too fast here.”  
“Too fast? What do you mean, too fast? You don’t love me anymore.” Faith had raised her voice. The man at the counter turned around and watched with anticipation. His eyes were shining. “Maybe he was a truck driver,” Gary thought.  
“I love you, Faith. I always have.”  
“Then marry me!”   
“Maybe…”   
“Oh, come on.”   
They ate their burgers and drank the coffee in silence. Expecting more action, the ‘truck driver’ had turned back towards the counter in obvious disappointment. A man entered the restaurant. He was too warmly dressed for the hot weather: dirty brown cord pants, large white sneakers, and a baggy blue and white sports jacket. He went straight to the man at the counter and said in a high-pitched voice, “Hey sir, I’m travelin’to LA, can ya take me to Sacramento?”  
“No *sir*, I can *not*,” the ‘truck driver’ replied.  
Then the fellow walked to the family and asked for a ride. The parents ignored the man. He turned around, glared at Gary, and came towards the couple.

The grass was sprinkled with blue, yellow, and red flowers—a beautiful scenery in front of the backdrop of the forest.  
“It must be here somewhere,” Richard Miller insisted. “He said behind the stream and pointed at this place on the map.”  
Suddenly the wind changed, and the air filled with a very slight stench. The Millers followed the smell and found a shoe, then a blue jeans and a T-shirt, and then women’s underwear. In front of them, in one spot, the grass had darkened, and in the midst lay something, a composition of clothes and grey-brown matter.  
“Oh no,” Richard Miller said and grabbed his son’s arm.   
“Stay here!”  
“No, dad. I want to see.”   
They moved nearer and slowly realized what they had discovered. In front of them lay two decomposed bodies — skeletons. Richard Miller inspected the dead thoroughly. The left skeleton was fully dressed with men’s clothing, the other smaller person may have been naked at the time of death and something had stretched the lower body parts in a near right angle to the other skeleton. Richard Miller identified a hole in each skull. “Shot,” he mumbled. From his backpack he took a pair of plastic gloves, a tape recorder, and a folding rule. “Both holes, the left skull fractured, are probably of small caliber, maybe nine millimetre,” he said into the recorder. There was no jewelry near the remains. Then the sergeant put on the plastic gloves and searched the pockets of the jeans and shirt. He found 25 cents and a lighter. As he wanted to be as thorough as possible, he pulled the shirt towards the skull. There was a purse lying between pelvis and first rib. “There’s no weapon here. Maybe the suspect searched the dead body and threw or lay the purse back onto the body,” Richard Miller told his son who probed the surrounding area. Inside the purse were no bills, but the sergeant found a picture of a young woman. “Maybe the deceased on the right,” Richard Miller thought. Then he pulled out a driver’s license. Gary Glass. While Richard Miller put the purse with the coins and lighter into a plastic bag, Bob Miller, who was standing near the forest, called for him. Richard Miller walked over to his son and looked down at the remains of an infant. “Savaged by animals,” Richard Miller concluded.

His name was Leonard; a tall and heavy man in his end thirties with a slender face, thin lips and protruding eyes. With his appearance disheveled and intimidating, he invoked some unease in Faith and Gary. First Gary was hesitant to take him to Sacramento, but they concurred when Leonard offered to pay for the gasoline and provide drink and food. Before the three continued their ride Leonard went to the shopping mall and bought the provisions.  
After a few miles of a quiet drive Leonard asked, “Where’re ya heading?” He was in the back and Faith sat beside Gary who was driving.  
“Santa Rosa,” Faith said.  
“And then we’ll stay on the west coast for the weekend,” Gary added.  
“With friends,” Faith remarked.  
“Sounds great.”  
“Where are you from?”, Faith asked.  
“My family lives’n Seattle. But I hardly see’em. Actually, never.”  
“Why not?”  
“There’re reasons.”  
After a moment of silence Faith said, “We’re from LA. I love LA.”  
“It depends where ya’r in LA, does’n it? I mean, who’d want to live in Skid Row. If I’d the choice, I would live somewhere else. All the lousy fucking hobos. Somebody should get rid’of’em.”  
“That’s cruel,” Faith said and turned around and put her feet back onto the dashboard. Through the rear mirror Gary had watched Leonard talk. He felt disgusted by the man in the back. For the next two hours they remained silent. In Reno, Faith took over driving. Leonard had no license to drive but offered it, anyway. Gary and Faith declined and wished to take Leonard to Sacramento as soon as possible.  
“What do you do for a living?”, Gary asked.  
“How old is your child,” Leonard said.  
“Nearly eight months,” Faith responded with aversion.  
“A child brings a lot of burden, the money, the caring and so on.”  
“Not to forget the pleasure and delight!”, Faith replied.  
Leonard laughed and smiled. “Pleasure and delight, she says. If ya believe so, lady.”  
He laughed again.  
“I work’ere and there, mister. Need’a repair or some paintin? I can do it.  What about ya two?”  
“I’m a secretary.”  
“And I’m a car mechanic.”  
“We both live and work in Salt Lake,” Faith said.  
“Salt Lake City. Been there, been lots of places. How much money do ya have with ya?”  
“Why do you ask?” Gary said.   
“We could buy some dope in Sacramento, if ya’re interested. Ya keep most of it. A little for me.” Leonard beamed at Faith in anticipation of her reaction.  
“We don’t take drugs,” they replied at the same time.  
“Pity.”   
Leonard fell into a long silence. Faith turned on the radio for some music and the news. Nothing in particular had happened in the world and the music had a soothing effect on Faith. Her dislike for Leonard had increased. Both Gary and Faith had looked at each other questioningly. The fact that Leonard would soon depart in Sacramento and they would be alone again comforted both.  
Reflected upon Leonard's eyes were the shapes and colors near the road, now intermixed into lines that ran parallel to the vehicle as he focused on one point outside the window. A feeling of empowerment rose in him and filled the emptiness. Now, he felt a little less worthless. From that day on his life would change, he decided, and theirs, too.
In Sacramento Gary asked Leonard where he wanted to get out.  
“Take Interstate 5 up north.”  
“North?”  
“Yeah, we’ll be going up north. I have business in Seattle.”  
“But you said LA. You wanted to travel to LA.” Faith said.  
“I changed my mind. We’ll be going to Seattle.”  
“No,” said Gary and halted the car next to the pedestrian. In that moment Leonard pulled the pistol from his coat, a 9mm Sig P226, and pointed it against Gary’s neck.  
“I told ya to drive onto Interstate 5, mister.”  
“He’s got a gun, Gary!” Faith cried out.  
Gary was in a state of shock, but after a few seconds he realized that both their lives were at stake and he followed Leonards instruction. Gary loved Faith and the baby more than anything in his life, so he drove the black Ford onto the highway up north towards Seattle. “We’ll take Leonard to Seattle and then be safe,” Gary thought. But about half way Leonard decided to get rid of them and would take the car alone to Seattle. He told them he knew a small hut in the woods where he would tie them up and lock them in. It would take them a few hours to escape, but they would live. Gary parked the car on a small dirt road in the western woods of Oregon state and the three walked about one and a half miles into the forest. They reached a valley near a stream on that Friday morning in autumn. And there Leonard shot Gary and told Faith to take off her clothes. He raped her ferociously. Ended her pain with a shot in the head. Leonard carried Gary to where Faith was lying and left. Back at the car, he drove to a small and ramshackle house in Seattle and killed his parents. Then he pulled the trigger one last time.
